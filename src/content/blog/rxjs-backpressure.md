I'll explain backpressure, sympotms and handling strategies when it is actually occures.

Problem

1. producer sends data at rate more than the consumer can handle
2. consumer is inefficient
3. limited resources
4. Cascading Backpressure

Solution

1. Priorities operation
2. Throw away new event.

Takeaways
By the end of this writing, user should be able to identify backpressure (in browser, backend, or mobile), put a strategy to handle it and use proper methods.

## Introduction

Simply put, it's the pressure of too much incoming data that our system can't handle at once. It's like trying to drink water from a fire hose.
